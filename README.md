# OpenVNC

OpenVNC aims to be a cross-platform VNC server written to conform to the offical [RFB Protocol](https://www.realvnc.com/docs/rfbproto.pdf) standards.  It's currently only being tested on OSX using the free [RealVNC Viewer](https://www.realvnc.com/download/viewer/).

## TODO
- [ ] implement test suite
- [ ] finish handling all client event types
- [ ] add keyboard / mouse control for OSX / Unix
- [ ] add in Windows support for keyboard / mouse control via [winapi-rs](https://github.com/retep998/winapi-rs)
